# Problem Statement: Given the heads of two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
# Examples:
# Input Format: 
# (Pointer/Access to the head of the two linked lists)
# num1  = 342, num2 = 564
# l1 = [2,4,3]
# l2 = [5,6,4]
# Result: sum = 807; L = [7,0,8]
# Explanation: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, reverse the numbers first to get the or original number and then add them as â†’ 342 + 465 = 807.

# Time Complexity: O(max(m,n)). Assume that m and n represent the length of l1 and l2 respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most max(m,n) times.
# Space Complexity: O(max(m,n)). The length of the new list is at most max(m,n)+1.
